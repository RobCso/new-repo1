      <br>
     
    <p> Hi there this is my first personal website, made as a part of project work for code_your_future. I have only really started with programming few days ago so I am bit struggling and I am all over the place but hopefully can finish this project in time. 
      So, I have come across these fantastic people as I was looking into doing some volunteering and found that they could help me with my plans.
      I have struggled with anxiety and depression since early childhood and while being lucky to be born in a European country with a lot of opportunities for personal growth, I was unable to fulfil my aims.

    </p>
